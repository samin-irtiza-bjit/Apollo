## 2. Project Description

Apollo is a project made for getting the highest marks in this exam. The project helps the members to acieve the top marks in the exam without getting any minus marking and to make working life easier for them.<br>
The main technologies used were git, zoom, google and bing. <br>
**Git**: Git was used so that the members can collaborate in one repository along with the exam coordinator in order to participate in the exam.
<br>
**Zoom**: Zoom was used to make sure that any instruction from the examiner and the queries from the examinees can be shared.
<br>
**Google**: Google is a top notch search engine which was used in order to search for any problems to solve or site to visit for the examinees.
<br>
**Bing**: Bing is also a top class search engine and has many information and sites which other search engines may not have.
<br>
The challanges that we faced are given below:
